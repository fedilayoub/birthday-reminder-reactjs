# Birthday reminder
This is a very simple and sweet exercise I saw in the **Coding addict** Youtube Channel and that I tried to reproduce myself.  
It's purpose is to understand the way **useState** hook works which is illustrated in the reset button behavior that changes the state to an empty array thus all birthdays are delelted.
